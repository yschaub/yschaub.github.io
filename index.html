            <h2>The Brief</h2>
            <p>Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform which helps people bring creative projects to life. We were asked to expand the types of projects to include ones that will be funded on a repeated schedule instead of backing a project only once.</p>

            
            <h2>Setup</h2>
            <p><b>Duration:</b> 10 days <br/>
            <b>Team Members:</b> Ed Jenkins, Luisa Sousa, Yann Schaub <br/>
            <b>Techniques & Methodologies used</b>: competitive analysis, surveys & interviews, personas & user journeys, sketching & wireframing, usability testing, visual design </p>

        <h1 class="text-center">Discovery</h1>
        <p class="subheader text-center">We spent the first week doing research. The goal was to identify and understand user needs.</p>

            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>

            <p>We looked at different crowdfunding platforms that are currently available and compared them to each other. We wanted to see which payment options they offer and what kind of categories they support. </p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="span-6">
                    <p>GoFundMe:<br/> Has every category under the sun and offers really flexible payment-models (Personal Campaign, Charity Campaign, All or Nothing campaign)</p>
                </div>  

                <div class="span-6">
                    <p>Patreon:<br/> Their monthly subscription model enables creatives to dedicate more time and resources to creating their regular content.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>Surveys</h2>
            <p>We sent out surveys to identify and understand the main needs of our users. We had these three objectives in mind:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How much money they are willing to invest in projects within a given timescales.</li>
                <li>What type of projects they are willing to invest in.</li>
                <li>What rewards they expect in return for their investment.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We got 150 responses, 80% of our respondents were in the age range of 18–34</p>

            <h3>Key learnings from the Survey</h3>
            <p>The majority aren’t just one-off pledgers. They are in the habit of making regular payments and are familiar with the concept of subscription services. They’re happy to support friends, family & creative individuals and/or what they believe to be a good cause.</p>


            <h2>User Interviews</h2>
            <p>The survey was mainly aimed at backers. With the user interviews we tried to get more insight into the habits of people that have previously launched crowdfunding campaigns. We also wanted to understand what kind of projects would or wouldn’t work within a subscription based model. </p>

                    <ul>
                    <li>traditional one-off projects probably wouldn’t suit a recurring model as the work required to keep an audience engaged at every stage would be too daunting</li>
                    <li>projects where the rewards and content are easily replicable and are of relatively low costs to creators would be more suitable</li>
                    </ul>


                    <h2>Personas</h2>
                    <p>We’ve used Personas to communicate the findings from our research. We split them into two categories: The Creator and The Backer. </p>

                <h1 class="text-center">Prototyping and Testing</h1>
                <p class="subheader text-center">After our research phase we moved into the design stage. Using the Design Studio Method we generated loads of designs for both our backer creator personas. </p>
            </div>

            <img src="img/prototype.jpg">

        <div class="content">

            <h2>Paper Prototyping</h2>

            <p>Following the philosophy of “test early, test often” we created two rough paper prototypes to test and validate our assumptions. </p>


            <h3>Creator-Flow</h3>

            <p><b>Task:</b> Create a Project that uses the new feature of recurring payments.</p>

            <p><b>Result:</b> The part that caused most confusion was the initial setup screen where the user has to choose between the “classic” Kickstarter campaign and the new one. In a first version we used the words “One-Off” and “Ongoing” which caused some confusion. </p>

            <h3>Backer-Flow</h3>

            <p><b>Task:</b> Find a Project you’re interested and back the project with a recurring pledge.</p>

            <p><b>Result:</b> The distinction between “classic” and “new” project worked pretty well. However, we still found that we could improve on the wording. This time we used “subscription” to name the projects with the recurring-payment option.</p>

            <p>After several rounds of testing and iterating we took it to the next level and created a digital, high-fidelity prototype.</p>


            <h2>Interactive Prototype</h2>

            <p>We wanted to understand how people perceived our newly designed page. Some of the Feedback we got:</p>

            <blockquote>&laquo;What does it offer to me? What am I paying for?&raquo;</blockquote>

            <blockquote>&laquo;How much exactly am I paying?&raquo;</blockquote>

            <p>The overall layout of the site was pretty clear. However it became pretty obvious that we would need to tweak the wording and adjust the hierarchy of the information. </p>

            <h1 class="text-center">Visual Design</h1>
            <p class="subheader text-center">Adding the visual layer</p>

        <div class="wide">

            <img src="img/visualdesign.jpg">

        </div>


        <div class="content">

          <p>The last step was to add a visual layer on top of our design. This was a fairly easy process as we could make use of the existing Kickstarter Branding. However it’s also a really crucial one as this breathes life into our prototype and makes it really shine.</p>
